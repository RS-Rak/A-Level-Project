# Welcome to my A Level Project - An Unnamed RPG  

### Brief  
My solution will be a 2D top-down RPG game. The underlying story will revolve around the player character discovering more about their own history, through cutscenes at the end of major boss fights, or dialogue with various NPCs (Non-Player Characters). There will be at least 3 dungeons featured in the end game, with at least one boss fight. These dungeon areas will be connected via overworld segments, containing NPC towns where shops may be found, or areas with weaker enemies who respawn, for gathering resources. If I get far ahead enough in development, Iâ€™d like for these NPCs to offer quests as well, which can be managed and viewed via the quest menu.  

### How can I see your progress?
While I've been a little lax with it, if you go to the wiki page on the top, I'm going to begin making some blog posts deteailing my thoughts, how certain concepts will work, and some images showcasing development progress.
